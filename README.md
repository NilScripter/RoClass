# RoClass
*NOTE:* **(This is meant to be used in Roblox, however, there may be some use cases outside of Roblox)**

*NOTE:* **This uses the MIT Liscence**

## Uses
Obviously, RoClass is used to create classes.  However, it is quite easy to do so with metatables.  These are some things
that normal, metatable classes cannot achieve:

### Private Values
   - In some cases, you want some values in your class to be private, which cannot be done with metatable OOP.
### Automated Getters and Setters
   - Typing getters and setters can become tedious and repetitive.  RoClass creates them for you, including a way to edit their names
### Locked and ReadOnly Values
   - Locked and ReadOnly values are used by Roblox themselves.  This functionality allows users to have more control over their classes
### A Signal class
   - Since Roblox has Events and Connections (rather than loops), you can utilize a 'mock' version of this. This class is exactly like the Connection API.

### And much more!
